**Continuous, audit-ready security design review for cloud and agentic systems.**

Attestral reads your Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, and MCP/agent configs, builds one system model, reviews it against a deterministic rule pack (with an optional local ML layer for prompt injection, LLM reasoning, and an LLM-as-judge), and emits a design review with a **tamper-evident evidence chain** you can hand to reviewers, auditors, and customers. It then compiles the reviewed design into a runtime policy and diffs live telemetry back against it.

```bash
pip install attestral
attestral scan ./my-project
```

## The loop in one picture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["attestral scan<br/><b>attest</b>"] --> B["attestral verify<br/><b>prove</b>"]
    A --> C["attestral compile<br/><b>enforce</b>"]
    C --> D["attestral drift<br/><b>detect</b>"]
    D -->|"design changed?<br/>re-attest"| A
    style A fill:#96222E,color:#fff
    style B fill:#1F6A4A,color:#fff
```

Attest the design, prove the record has not been altered, compile it into a default-deny runtime policy, and detect when what runs diverges from what was reviewed. The whole loop runs offline, on a laptop, free.

## How a scan works (the pipeline)

```mermaid

    subgraph ING["1 · Ingest"]

| Layer | What it does | Reproducible? | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 Deterministic** | 57 typed matchers over the model, fail-closed (unknown matcher never matches) | Yes, fully | Free, offline |
| **L2 ML** (optional, `attestral[ml]`) | Local DeBERTa classifier scores agentic text surfaces (MCP tool/server descriptions, system prompts) for prompt injection / jailbreaks | Pinned model + revision | Free, offline after first cache |
| **L3 LLM** (optional) | Elicits novel design threats, and a judge cross-examines findings to cut false positives | Verdicts recorded in the chain | Your API key |

Every finding carries its `origin`, so the deterministic core is never silently mixed with model reasoning. That separation is what makes the review audit-grade.

## Install and run the whole loop (60 seconds)

```bash
pip install attestral

attestral scan examples/demo-project -o review        # attest  -> review.md + review.json
attestral verify review.json                          # prove   -> chain VALID
attestral compile examples/demo-project -o policy.yaml # enforce -> default-deny policy
attestral drift policy.yaml examples/demo-project/runtime-events.jsonl --fail-on-drift  # detect
```

## The four commands

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph scan["attestral scan"]
        s1["Terraform + MCP"] --> s2["findings + evidence chain<br/>md / json / sarif"]
    end
    subgraph verify["attestral verify"]
        v1["report.json"] --> v2["VALID / INVALID<br/>(offline)"]
    end
    subgraph compile["attestral compile"]
        c1["attested model"] --> c2["default-deny policy<br/>bound to chain head"]
    end
    subgraph drift["attestral drift"]
        d1["policy + telemetry"] --> d2["drift findings"]
    end
```

```bash
# SCAN: review a project (Terraform + MCP configs discovered automatically)
attestral scan ./my-project --format both          # md + json
attestral scan . --fail-on high                    # CI gate: exit 1 on high/critical
attestral scan . --format sarif -o attestral       # SARIF -> GitHub Security tab + PR annotations

# VERIFY: prove a report has not been altered (no network, no server)
attestral verify review.json

# COMPILE: turn the attested design into a default-deny mcp-guard policy
attestral compile ./my-project -o policy.yaml

# DRIFT: diff runtime telemetry against the attested design
attestral drift policy.yaml events.jsonl --fail-on-drift
```

## The sophistication layers (optional)

```bash
# ML prompt-injection scan of agentic text surfaces (local, offline after first cache).
# Scores MCP tool/server descriptions and system-prompt files with a pinned
# DeBERTa classifier; hits are tagged origin: ml and flow into the same evidence chain.
pip install "attestral[ml]"
attestral scan ./my-project --ml
attestral scan ./my-project --ml --ml-revision <sha> --ml-threshold 0.7   # pin + tune

# LLM threat elicitation on top of the deterministic layer
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
attestral scan ./my-project --llm

# LLM-as-judge: cross-examine findings to cut false positives.
# Verdicts (confirmed / false_positive / needs_review) are recorded in the chain.
export ATTESTRAL_JUDGE_API_KEY=...                 # or reuse ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
attestral scan . --judge --judge-panel 3           # 3 judges vote per finding
attestral scan . --judge --judge-suppress          # auto-waive confident false positives, on the record
```

The judge never deletes a finding. A confident `false_positive` becomes a machine-generated waiver carrying the judge's reasoning: suppressed from the gate, but kept on the record.

### Tuning / training the ML layer

The ML layer ships pointed at a DeBERTa classifier already fine-tuned for prompt injection, so **start zero-shot** (`--ml`, no training). If you need to adapt it to your own surfaces, climb three tiers - use as-is, calibrate the `--ml-threshold` on your labeled data, then fine-tune only if a gap remains. A runnable recipe (fine-tune + threshold-calibration scripts, data format, and where to source training data) lives in [`training/`](training/README.md).

## Baseline and waivers

Real repos start with findings. A waiver accepts a known risk and keeps the gate green without hiding anything: the waived finding stays in the evidence chain with its justification, and becomes a SARIF suppression (GitHub shows it dismissed, not open).

```yaml
# attestral-waivers.yaml  (auto-discovered at the scan root)
waivers:
  - rule: ATL-005
    component: aws_db_instance.app     # or "*" for every component
    reason: Encryption enforced at the storage layer; tracked in SEC-1234.
    expires: 2026-12-31                # optional
```

Fail-safe: a waiver with no `reason` is ignored, and an expired waiver stops suppressing. A finding can only be silenced by a current, justified exception.

## What it catches (57-rule pack)

| Area | Examples |
|---|---|
| **AWS** (CIS-grounded) | public S3/RDS/Redshift, `0.0.0.0/0` security groups, wildcard IAM, unencrypted RDS/EBS/EFS/Neptune, disabled backups, KMS rotation off, public EC2/EKS, CloudTrail gaps, mutable ECR tags, plaintext ELB listeners |
| **Azure** | public blob access, non-HTTPS storage, public SQL, wildcard NSG rules, Key Vault purge protection off, Postgres/MySQL SSL not enforced |
| **GCP** | `0.0.0.0/0` firewall rules, public Cloud SQL, SQL without SSL, bucket uniform-access off, GKE legacy ABAC |
| **Kubernetes** (CIS K8s) | privileged containers, privilege escalation, dangerous capabilities, run-as-root, host network/PID, hostPath mounts, missing resource limits, mutable image tags |
| **Agentic / MCP** (OWASP LLM Top 10, MCP research) | shell-capable servers, broad filesystem roots, non-TLS transport, secrets in env, auto-installed packages (supply chain), mutable `@latest` tags (rug-pull), outbound-fetch/browser tools |
| **ML layer** (`attestral[ml]`) | prompt-injection / jailbreak text in MCP tool & server descriptions and system-prompt files |
| **Cross-cutting** | agent runtime and cloud sharing no declared boundary controls |

Every finding maps to NIST 800-53, ASVS, SOC 2, CIS (AWS/Azure/GCP/K8s), OWASP LLM/Agentic, and MITRE ATLAS references.

## Real-world benchmark

Run on [TerraGoat](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat) (Bridgecrew's deliberately-vulnerable Terraform), same repo, growing rule packs:

| | TerraGoat AWS | TerraGoat Azure | TerraGoat GCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.4.0 (10 rules) | 3 | - | - |
| v0.5.0 (26 rules) | 6 | - | - |
| v0.6.0 (57 rules) | **7** | **2** | **3** |

v0.6.0 extends coverage from AWS-only to AWS + Azure + GCP + Kubernetes (12 findings across the three TerraGoat clouds). The pipeline (ingest, evidence chain, tamper detection, gate, SARIF) is verified on real code; the rule pack keeps growing to raise coverage.

## Use it in CI

```yaml
# .github/workflows/attestral.yml
name: attestral
on: [pull_request]
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write        # to upload to the Security tab
jobs:
  design-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
        with: { python-version: "3.12" }
      - run: pip install "attestral[terraform]"
      - run: attestral scan . --format sarif -o attestral
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with: { sarif_file: attestral.sarif }
      - run: attestral scan . --fail-on high      # hard gate (auto-uses attestral-waivers.yaml)
```

Ready-made workflows live in `examples/github-actions/`.

## Writing custom rules

Rules are YAML with structured matchers. No `eval` anywhere, and an unknown matcher fails closed (never matches).

```yaml
rules:
  - id: ORG-001
    title: Internal load balancer missing auth attribute
    severity: high
    target: aws_lb                     # component type prefix, or "model"
    match: { attr_missing: auth }
    description: ...
    recommendation: ...
    frameworks: ["NIST AC-3", "SOC2 CC6.1"]
```

```bash
python -c "from attestral.rules import RuleEngine; RuleEngine(['org_rules.yaml'])"
```

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,terraform,llm]"   # add ,ml for the DeBERTa layer (pulls torch)
pytest -q                 # offline suite; the live judge test skips without a key
ruff check attestral tests
```

To run the live judge test, set `ATTESTRAL_JUDGE_API_KEY` (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and re-run `pytest -q`.
