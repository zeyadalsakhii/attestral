"""Compile-the-fix: turn one finding into the enforceable control that closes it.

`compile.py` compiles a whole attested design into a runtime policy. This goes
the other direction, one finding at a time: for a specific finding, it emits the
exact mcp-guard control that neutralizes THAT finding, an explanation of why the
control closes it, and a verification verdict, all bound to the review's chain
head. A remediation that is also an enforceable control is the payoff of the
attest -> compile -> drift loop; no linter can offer it, because a linter has no
runtime policy to compile into.

Two honest verification kinds, never conflated:

* `re-synthesized` - for capability/fleet findings, the fix removes a capability,
  the model is re-synthesized, and the finding no longer fires. This is proven
  over the model, deterministically.
* `enforced-at-proxy` - for a per-server structural finding, the control is a
  constraint mcp-guard enforces at invocation (TLS-only, forbid-env-secrets, an
  egress allowlist, a deny). The control provably governs the rule's condition;
  it is enforced at runtime rather than re-derived here.

The control fragment is a valid slice of the same mcp-guard policy `compile`
produces, so a fix can be merged straight into the compiled policy.
