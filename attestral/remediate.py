"""Structured remediation: the concrete source edit that clears each finding.

Every rule already ships a prose recommendation. This goes one step more
concrete: for a finding, it reads the rule's own matcher and the offending
component's actual value, and produces the exact edit to make in the source, a
before and an after, tied to the file the component came from. A finding a
developer can act on in one line gets fixed; a finding that only says what is
wrong gets ignored.

This is the source-side twin of `attestral fix`: `remediate` tells you the
change to make in your config so the finding never fires, `fix` compiles the
runtime control that enforces it at the proxy. Together they close the
"so what do I do about this" gap from both ends.

Derivation is deterministic and honest: a boolean security flag flips, a missing
control is added, a bad-prefix or bad-token value is transformed, and anything
model-level or not mechanically derivable falls back to the rule's
recommendation rather than inventing an edit.
