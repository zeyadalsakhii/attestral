"""Guard the published ML-layer precision/recall numbers against silent rot.

evaluation/ml-precision-recall.md cites measured numbers. The heuristic tier is
a pure function of the pattern bank and the vendored labeled set, so its floor
is enforceable in CI with no model download. The model tiers are exercised by
`python -m evaluation.ml_eval` on a machine with the extras installed; their
numbers live in evaluation/ml-results.json and the md.

Floors are deliberately below the measured values (precision 0.95, recall 0.14
at the 0.5 default threshold): the gate catches a pattern-bank regression that
tanks the published claim, not normal drift from adding patterns.
