# Attestral roadmap

The metric is **conviction**: does a skeptical security engineer install it, keep
it past the first run, and tell someone. The two things that decide that are
time-to-first-value and false-positive rate - not rule count, not engine novelty.
So the order below is friction-and-noise first, differentiated moat second,
because nobody reaches the moat if they bounce on setup. The research-grounded
uplifts are real, but they are sequenced *after* the table stakes on purpose.

Legend: **size** S/M/L · **who's unconvinced without it**.

## The long game (the 12-24 month bets)

The tactical milestones below all ladder up to five durable bets. These are the
things that, if we win them, make Attestral hard to displace. The milestones are
how we get there; these are the "there".

1. **Own "agentic design review" as a category.** Be the tool a team reaches for
   the moment they wire an agent, the way Semgrep is the reflex for code. The
   moat is depth on the agentic surface (MCP, prompt injection, tool poisoning,
   excessive agency, the OWASP Agentic/LLM Top 10, MITRE ATLAS), never cloud rule
   count. *Win condition:* cited as the default agent-security scanner in
   community guidance; our agentic pack is the reference others map to.
   *Fed by:* the agentic rule waves, M11 (agent code), M-EVAL.

2. **The review IS the runtime control (attest -> compile -> drift).** Nobody
   else closes the loop from a design review to an enforceable default-deny
   runtime policy and continuous drift detection. Make it the headline and make
   it continuous. *Win condition:* teams run the compiled policy in production
   and the drift daemon catches a real rug-pull. *Fed by:* M10 (compile-the-fix),
   M13 (drift daemon), M15 (attestation registry).

3. **The fleet is the unit, not the repo.** An org's whole agent estate modeled
   as one graph, continuously, so toxic flows that span teams and repos surface
   before they ship. *Win condition:* a cross-repo flow found in a real
   multi-team estate that no per-repo tool could see. *Fed by:* M12 (shipped seed),
   M11, cross-repo continuous modeling.

4. **A signed, portable, verifiable evidence artifact.** Move from tamper-evident
   to signed and attributable (in-toto / DSSE / Sigstore), so the review is
   something procurement and auditors already recognize. *Win condition:* an
   auditor accepts an Attestral attestation as evidence a control operated.
   *Fed by:* the chain-signing milestone, M4 (accept-risk records), M16.

5. **Network-effect infrastructure for MCP trust.** The shared "OSV / deps.dev
   for MCP tools": a community index of attested known-good tool manifests, so a
   rug-pull is caught against a community baseline, not just a prior local scan,
   plus a contributable rule-pack registry. *Win condition:* value grows with the
   network; a poisoned tool is flagged the day it changes, for everyone. *Fed by:*
   M14, M15.

Underneath all five, the non-negotiable posture: **honest, adversarial
evaluation.** Publish where our own detection breaks under adaptive attack. In a
field full of overclaiming, the tool that documents its own limits is the one a
skeptical security engineer trusts, and that trust is the real distribution.

## Done

- **M0 - Credibility reframe.** The adversarial-validation output claimed "proof"
  where it shows graph *reachability*. Reframed across the CLI, terminal report,
  and every site page to attack-path feasibility / reachability over the modeled
  graph, with the sound-over-approximation assumption stated explicitly.
  Reachability is now framed as necessary, not sufficient, for exploitation.
- **M-EVAL v1 - Agentic-detection benchmark** (`evaluation/`). Recall, benign
  false-positive rate, and rule coverage, run in CI. First honest numbers on the
  moat surface. Grows toward threat-labelled and adversarial (see M6).
- **Evaluator agent** (`.claude/agents/evaluator.md`) - an on-demand honest
  scorecard weighted to conviction, so this rating is repeatable, not a one-off.
- **M-SEV - Reachability-based severity** (`attestral/reachability.py`, on by
  default). A finding whose component sits on an attack chain the symbolic walk
  shows reachable carries that chain (a `path:` line naming entry → pivot →
  impact) and is raised one severity band, capped at the chain's own severity.
  Reachable findings also score the full AIVSS threat multiplier. The inverse is
  deliberately never done: a finding off every chain is not downgraded, because
  the absence of a modeled path is not evidence of safety. "Severity you can
  defend" - a raised HIGH ships with the walk that justifies it.
- **M1 - Zero-config proof.** Every scan opens with a discovery preamble
  ("Reviewed N components across M source files: <families>") and an honest
  "not SAST" note, so a clean result reads as clean, never "it did not look".
- **M4 - Accept-risk as an evidence-chain record** (`attestral accept`). A
  provenance + content-pinned waiver; a stale pin re-activates the finding.
- **M7 - Delightful PR action.** `scan --format md-summary` renders the reachable
  path; the `init` workflow SARIF-annotates, writes a job summary, and gates on
  net-new only via `--baseline`.
- **M9 - Structured remediation** (`attestral remediate`). The concrete source
  edit that clears each finding, derived from the rule matcher and the
  component's real value.
- **M10 - Compile-the-fix** (`attestral fix`). The enforceable mcp-guard control
  that neutralizes each finding, bound to the chain head, `re-synthesized` or
  `enforced-at-proxy`.
- **M11 - Ingest agent code** (`ingest/agent_code.py`). Python `@tool` /
  framework agents become `code_agent` capability surfaces; the whole analysis
  fires on code as on config.
- **M12 - Cross-repo fleet** (`attestral fleet`, ATL-213). The toxic flow that
  spans repos, which no single-repo scan can see.
- **M13 - Continuous drift** (`attestral drift --stdin/--watch`). A stateful
  `DriftMonitor` sidecar streams drift (rug-pulls, loops, volume) as it happens.
- **M16 - Trust & honesty** (`docs/limitations.md`). A plain "what it does not
  do" page, surfaced on the site, including where our own detection breaks.
- **Site - fully-fledged product pass.** Two-column hero with a live terminal, a
  standards strip, an "everything in the box" capabilities grid, and interactive
  cross-repo / config-or-code demos, deployed to attestral.vercel.app.

## Phase 0 - Conviction (remove friction and noise)

- **M1 - Zero-config, proven.** *(autodiscovery already works: `attestral scan
  <repo>` finds Terraform, K8s, `.mcp.json`, agent configs and produces
  cross-component findings with no model file.)* Remaining is to **prove** it: a
  90-second "one command, useful output" path front-and-centre in the README and
  the demo GIF, a crisp "found N surfaces across M ingesters" preamble on every
  scan, and an honest note on what it does *not* read (arbitrary agent code - by
  design, this is design review, not SAST). **S · the drive-by evaluator who
  decides in 90 seconds.**
- **M2 - Real-systems gallery.** Run Attestral against 15-20 popular open-source
  MCP servers / agent projects (the `research/mcp-ecosystem` corpus is the seed),
  responsibly disclose, and publish the actual cross-component flows found. One
  screenshot of a genuine lethal-trifecta path in a project people recognize
  converts more skeptics than any table. Doubles as the evaluation corpus and
  feeds M-EVAL. **M · every skeptic who wants proof it works on real code.**
- **M3 - False-positive budget.** Make the FP number a first-class, gated,
  visible contract: per-rule confidence, a benign-corpus FP-rate tracked in CI
  (started in M-EVAL, budget = 0 on benign), `--min-confidence`, and one-line
  inline suppression next to a finding. A noisy scanner gets muted and
  uninstalled; this is the retention lever. **S-M · the engineer on their second
  run.**
- **M4 - Onboarding polish.** `attestral init` in one command, a GitHub Action and
  pre-commit hook that gate a PR out of the box, SARIF into the Security tab, and
  a Claude Code skill/plugin so it is discoverable where agents are built.
  **S · the team lead wiring it into CI on a Friday.**

## Phase 1 - The differentiated artifact (the moat, after table stakes)

The through-line: the differentiation is the signed, verifiable, IFC-grounded
artifact that carries a design from review into enforcement - not the rule count.

- **M5 - Sign the evidence chain.** Move from tamper-evident to tamper-evident
  *and attributable*. A raw SHA-256 chain only means something to whoever already
  holds the true head. Wrap the sealed review in a DSSE envelope, sign with Ed25519
  or Sigstore keyless OIDC, export as an in-toto attestation, optionally anchor the
  head in a transparency log. Slots into the SLSA / Sigstore / in-toto stack
  procurement already recognizes; no MCP-specific design-review attestation has
  shipped yet. **M · auditors and procurement; "hand it to an auditor" is hollow
  until the head is signed.** (Refs: Sigstore, SLSA, in-toto; GitHub artifact
  attestations.)
- **M6 - Information-flow lattice under toxic-flow.** The lethal-trifecta finding
  is heuristic today (named source/sink groups over the graph). Attach
  confidentiality and integrity labels to sources and sinks in the SystemModel and
  the trifecta becomes a defensible property: a high-confidentiality source reaches
  a low-integrity exfil sink without passing a declassifier. Citable and precise
  instead of a severity with an opinion attached; connects to CaMeL / FIDES /
  Progent. This also upgrades M-EVAL toward threat-labelled cases. **M-L ·
  researchers and reviewers who see "heuristic" and discount it.** (Refs: FIDES;
  CaMeL.)
- **M7 - Compile as a provable narrowing.** The compile step already emits a
  default-deny policy; make it a *verified least-privilege* result. Adopt
  Progent's SMT expansion/narrowing check: prove the compiled policy is strictly a
  narrowing of the reviewed model's ambient capability, and classify every
  re-attestation as expansion or narrowing, with expansions forcing re-review.
  Turns "compile to default-deny" into "compile to a policy with a confinement
  guarantee." **L · the buyer who needs the enforcement to be provably faithful to
  the review.** (Refs: Progent 2504.11703; Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic
  Systems 2602.16708.)
- **M8 - Close the design-to-runtime gap on rug-pulls and schema poisoning.** A
  single design-time snapshot structurally cannot see a tool whose description or
  schema is silently changed after approval (the benchmark records this as a known
  gap, `gap-description-rugpull`). Fix it on the runtime side: the drift telemetry
  schema carries the *actual* description and schema served at invocation, hashed,
  and diffed against the attested hash. This is where the mcp-guard integration
  earns its keep and "the review is the policy" becomes a genuine end-to-end
  control. **M-L · anyone who knows tool poisoning is a runtime rug-pull, not a
  tag.** (Refs: Invariant Labs tool poisoning; Microsoft 2026-06-30.)
- **M9 - Memory-entry provenance signing.** Extend M5's signing to memory: make the
  trust label part of a CBOR-canonical record covered by the writer's Ed25519
  signature, so a relabelling attempt produces an entry whose signature no longer
  verifies. Turns the static world-writable / vector-store findings (and the
  uncovered ATL-113) into cryptographic detection. **S-M (after M5) · teams whose
  agents have persistent memory.** (Refs: MemLineage.)

## Phase 2 - Adversarial evaluation (raise the bar on ourselves)

- **M10 - Defense-aware evaluation.** Static-benchmark wins evaporate under
  adaptive attack. Map every agentic finding class to the disclosed 2026 corpus
  (NSA/CISA MCP guidance, CVE-2025-6514, MCPTox, the AgentDojo injection catalog)
  and report precision/recall against it, then run defense-aware attacks against
  Attestral's own detection and publish where it breaks. "Here is where our own
  tool fails under adaptive attack" is the intellectual honesty the field now
  demands - and a stronger story than a clean pass. Builds directly on M-EVAL.
  **L · researchers, and anyone who has watched a static benchmark get gamed.**

## Notes on sequencing

Phase 0 is what earns the right to Phase 1: a signed, IFC-grounded artifact nobody
installs is worth less than a quiet, one-command scanner people keep. Ship the
conviction milestones first; let the benchmark and the gallery carry the proof;
then build the moat on an audience that is already using the tool.
