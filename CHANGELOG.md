# Changelog

All notable changes to Attestral. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/). This file is enforced: the suite
fails if the package version has no entry here (`tests/test_docs_sync.py`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Four cloud rules from the research radar sweep (pack 228 -> 232).** ATL-067
  (CloudTrail trail with logging switched off, an audit trail that records
  nothing), ATL-068 (GuardDuty detector declared but disabled), ATL-337 (Azure
  SQL Server accepting TLS below 1.2), and ATL-433 (Cloud SQL instance with
  automated backups disabled). Each cites a real CIS/NIST/FSBP control and ships
  with an isolated fixture (examples/aws-pack-ext, azure-pack, gcp-pack) and a
  test asserting it fires alone.
- **The benchmark has no review limbo and no coverage debt.** All ten unlabelled
  fires were adjudicated: every one was a documented true positive whose label
  was missing (`agent-fleet-flows` per-component checks, `agentic-risks` fleet
  flows ATL-214/216, `mcp-supply-chain` ATL-109), none was a precision bug. The
  last two uncovered agentic rules gained positive cases through two typed
  harness fields in `cases.yaml`: `fleet:` builds one model spanning repos the
  way `attestral fleet` does (exercises ATL-213) and `world_writable:` sets the
  o+w bit for the duration of the scan, since git cannot store it (exercises
  ATL-113). The scorecard now reads 116/116 recall, 0 false positives, 59/59
  agentic coverage.
- **The benchmark's benign tier now counts every rule band.** A benign design
  must be quiet across the whole pack, not just the agentic bands - a cloud
  false positive gets the tool muted just as fast. New benign case
  `benign-open-egress` (scoped ingress + world egress, the standard Terraform
  shape) locks the ATL-002 regression into `python -m evaluation.score`.
- **TerraGoat regression suite** (`tests/test_terragoat.py`): runs against the
  vendored deliberately-vulnerable corpus when present (skipped otherwise -
  `research/` is untracked). Pins the per-provider detection floor, exact
  ATL-002 = world-open-ingress equivalence, the egress-idiom non-finding, and
  that agentic rules stay silent on a pure-IaC repo.

### Fixed
- **Security-group CIDR matching is direction-aware (kills the first-scan false
  positive on real Terraform).** The ingester collected `cidr_blocks` from any
  nested block, ingress or egress, into one `_cidr_blocks` union, so ATL-002
  ("Security group open to the world", HIGH, an *ingress* rule by its own
  description) fired on the near-universal default-outbound idiom
  (`egress { cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] }` and `aws_security_group_rule` with
  `type = "egress"`). Both parse tiers now attribute every CIDR to a direction -
  from the enclosing `ingress`/`egress` block, or a rule resource's resolved
  `type` - and emit `_ingress_cidr_blocks` / `_egress_cidr_blocks` alongside the
  union. ATL-002 matches ingress only; a CIDR whose direction is not statically
  decidable stays union-only and never becomes an ingress finding (fail closed).
  ATL-032 (the default SG must hold *no* rules) deliberately keeps the
  direction-blind union.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Signed evidence chain: `attestral sign` (from tamper-evident to authentic).**
  The SHA-256 chain is tamper-evident but not authentic: an attacker could edit a
  finding, recompute the whole chain and a new head, and `verify` would still say
  VALID. `attestral sign` signs the chain head with an Ed25519 key inside a DSSE
  envelope (the Sigstore / in-toto envelope), and `attestral verify --public-key`
  now checks both integrity (no entry altered) and authenticity (this is the
  chain the key holder sealed, not a recomputed forgery). `--gen-key` makes a
  keypair; `sign` refuses a chain that is already broken. Signing needs the new
  `attestral[sign]` extra (`cryptography`, lazy-imported); the integrity check
  still runs with zero dependencies. New `attestral/signing.py`; tests in
  `tests/test_signing.py`.
- **The ML layer's precision/recall, measured and published.**
  `evaluation/ml_eval.py` scores every tier through the production scan path
  against a vendored independent labeled set (`deepset/prompt-injections`,
  Apache-2.0, 662 rows) and the 106 real surfaces ingested from the 33-repo
  MCP ecosystem corpus, with every flag human-adjudicated. Results:
  heuristic 0.950 precision / 0.144 recall, DeBERTa 0.965 / 0.414 (0.944
  recall on explicit injection phrasing); real-surface flags 28/106 vs 3/106,
  all benign. Full write-up in `evaluation/ml-precision-recall.md`, cited on
  the site's DeBERTa page; the heuristic's floors are enforced in CI
  (`tests/test_ml_eval.py`).
- **Kubernetes ingester expansion.** The K8s ingester now parses RBAC and
  network resources into first-class components: `k8s_rbac_role` (Role /
  ClusterRole, with wildcard-verb, wildcard-resource, and secrets-access
  signals), `k8s_rbac_binding` (RoleBinding / ClusterRoleBinding, with a
  cluster-admin-binding signal), and `k8s_network_policy` (default-deny
  detection). Pod and container hardening signals were added too: AppArmor
  profile, SELinux options, service-account name, a plaintext-secret-in-env
  detector, and a pod-level fallback for `runAsUser` so root is caught when it
  is set only at the pod level.
- **Six Kubernetes rules (ATL-530..535), pack 222 -> 228.** AppArmor explicitly
  unconfined (ATL-530), a secret hardcoded in a container env var (ATL-531),
  RBAC roles with wildcard resources (ATL-532) or wildcard verbs (ATL-533),
  RBAC access to Secrets (ATL-534), and a binding to the built-in cluster-admin
  role (ATL-535). Each cites its CIS Kubernetes control and ships with a
  fixture under `examples/k8s-hardening` and `examples/k8s-rbac`.
- **Ecosystem-composite fixture: one realistic project, every layer, known
  answers.** `examples/ecosystem-composite` composites the patterns the 33-repo
  public corpus actually exhibits into a plausible AI support-desk product and
  scans it as a known-answer test: 33 deterministic findings across cloud,
  Kubernetes, MCP supply chain, and the cross-boundary flows (with one attack
  path walked end to end), 4 seeded language positives across both ML tiers,
  and 2 negative controls that stay clean, including a benign `CLAUDE.md` that
  scores 0.75 raw and is correctly muted by the new instruction-surface gate.
  Benchmarked in the site's "Verified end to end" section.

### Changed
- **Heuristic ML tier: instruction-surface gate (26.4% real-repo flag rate down
  to 3.8%).** On `agent_instruction` surfaces (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `.cursorrules`, skill files) a `tool_poisoning` pattern hit alone no longer
  reports: imperative agent-directive phrasing is that file's ordinary register
  ("when asked to commit, first run the tests"), and it flagged 26 of 66 real
  repos' instruction files, every one adjudicated benign. The hit now counts
  only when a second, intent-revealing family co-occurs on the surface -
  secrecy, exfiltration, or a hidden channel - with evidence pooled across
  chunks (`ml.py::muted_on_surface`). Re-measured through `evaluation/ml_eval.py`
  on the 33-repo corpus: 28/106 flags fell to 4/106 while labeled-set
  precision/recall was untouched (0.950/0.144). Tool and manifest descriptions,
  system prompts, and the model tiers (which carry no category evidence) are
  outside the gate.
- **Site: the three review layers each get a dedicated deep-dive.** The landing
  page gains an interactive terminal that runs each layer (deterministic, ML,
  LLM-judge) against the same insecure agent with the real command output; new
  `deterministic.html` and `judge.html` field-notes pages, and the DeBERTa page
  gains a supervision section (proper supervised fine-tuning and weak
  supervision from the rule packs). Nav consolidates to a single "Review
  layers" entry.
- **`attestral validate --fail-on-reachable` prints `REACHABLE`, not `PROVEN`.**
  The walk demonstrates reachability in the modeled design; the FAQ renounced
  the word "proof" and the CI gate line now matches the epistemics.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-16

A large release: the attest-compile-drift loop becomes end to end, the review
gains cross-repo and code-defined-agent reach, severity gets defensible, and the
rule pack grows from 192 to 222.

### Added
- **AWS service-coverage rules (210 -> 222).** Twelve CIS-AWS / AWS FSBP checks
  extending the pack to more services: a public Lambda function URL (ATL-055),
  RDS without IAM auth (ATL-056), Redshift not forcing VPC-routed traffic
  (ATL-057), ElastiCache without at-rest (ATL-058) or in-transit (ATL-059)
  encryption, an unencrypted DocumentDB cluster (ATL-060), SageMaker notebooks
  with direct internet (ATL-061) or root (ATL-062) access, an ALB without
  deletion protection (ATL-063) or invalid-header dropping (ATL-064), an
  unencrypted Kinesis stream (ATL-065), and an unauthenticated API Gateway
  method (ATL-066). Fixtures in `examples/aws-pack-ext/`; tests in
  `tests/test_aws_pack_ext.py`.
- **Kubernetes hardening rules (206 -> 210).** Four more CIS-K8s / Pod Security
  checks against signals the ingester already emits: second-tier
  kernel-tampering capabilities disjoint from the famous six (ATL-526), the
  deprecated `gitRepo` volume (node-RCE, CVE-2024-10220 / CVE-2025-1767,
  ATL-527), out-of-tree `flexVolume` host drivers outside the CSI security model
  (ATL-528), and app workloads colocated in `kube-system` / `kube-public` with
  control-plane RBAC (ATL-529). The K8s pack is now at its ceiling on the
  current ingester surface; further Pod Security controls (AppArmor, SELinux,
  serviceAccountName, env/secretKeyRef, RBAC/NetworkPolicy ingestion) need new
  ingester signals first. Fixtures in `examples/k8s-pack-ext/`; tests in
  `tests/test_k8s_pack_ext.py`. Three more agentic checks,
  each backed by a new ingester-derived signal so the rule stays pure data:
  agent settings that pre-approve unrestricted command execution (`allow`
  includes `Bash(*)` / bare `Bash` / `*`, ATL-141, `_permissive_allow`); an A2A
  card that requires auth but via a long-lived static `apiKey` instead of
  short-lived OAuth tokens (ATL-142, `_weak_auth_scheme`); and a published
  registry manifest that pins a package to a mutable version (`latest` or none,
  ATL-143, `_has_mutable_pin`). Each is precise: a scoped `Bash(git status)`, an
  OAuth scheme, and an exact version pin all pass clean. Fixture
  `examples/agent-supply-trust`; tests in `tests/test_trust_supply_signals.py`;
  all three registered in the `evaluation/` benchmark.
- **Agentic hardening + fleet-flow rule wave (193 -> 203).** Ten new
  research-grounded agentic checks, biased entirely to the moat. Seven
  per-component: an MCP server installed straight from a Git/URL source
  (ATL-134), pulling packages from a non-default registry (ATL-135), disabling
  TLS certificate verification (ATL-136), launched with container
  isolation-breaking flags (ATL-137), exposing a Node inspector/debug port
  (ATL-138), or reached over plaintext WebSocket (ATL-140); plus a code-defined
  agent that grants shell/command execution (ATL-139). Three cross-boundary
  flows only the system model can see: untrusted input written into agent
  long-term memory (memory poisoning, ATL-214), a sampling-capable server
  sharing a runtime with autonomous tool execution (covert invocation, ATL-215),
  and indirect prompt injection that can reach cloud credentials (ATL-216).
  Anchored to the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026 (ASI02/03/04/05/06),
  the OWASP MCP Top 10 2025 (MCP04/05/06/07), OWASP LLM01/05/06, MITRE ATLAS, and
  Unit 42's MCP sampling research. Two new engine matchers
  (`model_sampling_covert_invocation`, `model_injection_reaches_cloud`), both
  fail-closed with tests. New fixtures `examples/mcp-supply-chain/` and
  `examples/agent-fleet-flows/`; tests in `tests/test_supply_chain_flow_rules.py`;
  all ten registered in the `evaluation/` benchmark.
- **Continuous drift: `attestral drift --stdin` / `--watch` (M13).** Point-in-time
  drift becomes a running sidecar. A new stateful `DriftMonitor` observes one
  runtime event at a time and returns only the new drift it triggers, so
  `--stdin` reads a live mcp-guard telemetry pipe and `--watch` tails the event
  log, both streaming drift the moment it happens: an unattested server, a
  denied invocation, a rug-pull (a served tool schema that no longer matches the
  attested manifest, fired once per change), a runaway loop, or a call-volume
  overrun (each budget fires once, when it crosses). Continuous beats
  point-in-time for anything claiming runtime awareness, and it is what makes
  "the review is the policy" an end-to-end control rather than two snapshots.
  New `DriftMonitor` in `attestral/drift.py`; tests in `tests/test_drift_monitor.py`.
- **Structured remediation: `attestral remediate` (M9).** The source-side twin
  of `attestral fix`. For each finding it reads the rule's own matcher and the
  component's real value and prints the concrete edit to make in the source: a
  boolean security flag to flip (`set publicly_accessible = false`), a bad value
  to replace (`http://... -> https://...`), a control to add, tied to the file
  the component came from. Derivation is deterministic and honest: model-level
  findings and ingester-derived (`_`-prefixed) attributes fall back to the
  rule's recommendation rather than inventing a field edit. New
  `attestral/remediate.py`; tests in `tests/test_remediate.py`.
- **Compile-the-fix: `attestral fix` (M10).** For each active finding, compile
  the exact mcp-guard control that neutralizes it, an explanation, and a
  verification verdict, all bound to the review's evidence-chain head. Two honest
  verification kinds: a compositional fleet finding is `re-synthesized` (the fix
  isolates a capability, the model is re-built without it, and the finding no
  longer fires, proven deterministically), and a per-server structural finding is
  `enforced-at-proxy` (a TLS-only / forbid-env-secrets / egress-allowlist / deny
  constraint mcp-guard applies at invocation). `--rule` narrows to one rule; `-o`
  writes the merged controls as a policy slice. A remediation that is also an
  enforceable runtime control is the payoff of the attest-compile-drift loop and
  the thing a linter structurally cannot offer. New `attestral/fix.py`; tests in
  `tests/test_fix.py`.
- **Cross-repo fleet modeling: `attestral fleet` (M12, flagship).** Agentic risk
  lives in the integration - a shell tool in one repo and an untrusted-input
  tool in another are each fine alone but together are an attack chain no
  per-repo scanner can see. `attestral fleet <repoA> <repoB> ...` merges several
  repos into one system model (tagging each component with its repo) and runs
  the full review over the union. New rule **ATL-213** fires only when the
  fleet's combined capabilities complete an attack chain that no single repo
  completes alone, naming which repo supplies the entry, the pivot, and the
  exfiltration; reachability escalation then raises a finding in one repo because
  another repo completes its chain. The detection lives in the rule engine
  (keyed on the `_repo` tags the fleet builder writes) so it is a real,
  documented, `explain`-able rule, inert on ordinary single-repo scans. New
  `attestral/fleet.py`; fixtures `examples/fleet-repo-{reader,runner}`; tests in
  `tests/test_fleet.py`. Capability-granting component types are now centralized
  as `TOOL_GRANTING_TYPES`, so MCP servers, subagents, and code agents all feed
  the fleet analysis uniformly.
- **Ingest agents defined in code, not just config (M11).** Most agents are
  wired in Python, so a config-only scanner sees a minority of deployments. A
  new `attestral/ingest/agent_code.py` AST-parses Python and models each file's
  agent surface as a `code_agent` component whose `_capabilities` are read from
  the tools it defines - `@tool` / `@function_tool` functions (capability
  inferred from the symbols the body uses: `subprocess` -> shell, `requests` ->
  network, a DB driver -> database, ...) and raw Anthropic/MCP tool dicts
  (classified from name + description). Because the capability vocabulary is the
  same one the MCP ingester emits, the fleet rules, attack-path synthesis,
  reachability escalation, and AIVSS all fire on agent code with **no new
  rules** - the lethal trifecta across a shell tool and an egress tool is the
  same flow whether declared in `.mcp.json` or three `@tool` functions.
  Precision over recall: a file is modeled only when it imports a known agent
  framework (Anthropic, OpenAI Agents SDK, LangChain/LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen,
  Pydantic AI, MCP/FastMCP) and defines at least one tool, and parsing is
  fail-open. The capability-granting component types are now centralized as
  `TOOL_GRANTING_TYPES` so every analysis sees code agents uniformly. Fixture in
  `examples/code-agent`; tests in `tests/test_agent_code.py`.
- **Delightful PR action: `md-summary` format + baseline-gated workflow.** A new
  `attestral scan --format md-summary` renders a compact GitHub-flavored summary
  - the reviewed surface, each reachable attack path as entry -> pivot ->
  impact, and a findings table naming each finding's reachability - built for a
  PR comment or `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. The scaffolded `attestral init` workflow
  now uploads SARIF for inline annotations, writes this summary to the job
  summary, and gates on **net-new** findings only (`--baseline` + `--fail-on
  high`), so a brownfield repo adopts without failing on day-one debt. Under a
  baseline the summary reflects what the change introduced. New
  `render_pr_summary` in `evidence.py`; tests in `tests/test_pr_summary.py`.
- **Zero-config discovery preamble (M1).** Every scan now opens with what
  autodiscovery found ("Reviewed N components across M source files:
  <families>") and an honest note that a design review reads declared config and
  agent wiring, not arbitrary application logic - so a clean scan reads as
  "clean", never "it did not look". `render_discovery` in `report_terminal.py`.
- **Risk acceptance as an audit record (`attestral accept`).** Accepting a
  finding is now itself an evidence-chain record, not just the absence of an
  alert. `attestral accept <path> <rule> <component> -r "why"` appends a waiver
  carrying provenance - who accepted (git identity), when, why, the evidence
  chain head of the review - plus a `finding_sha256` content pin over the rule,
  component, severity, and reachable chain as accepted. If the risk later
  changes (a rule wave re-rates it, or a new tool completes an attack chain
  through the component), the pin stops matching, the acceptance goes stale,
  and the finding comes back until the current risk is re-accepted. The
  suppressed finding carries `waived_by`/`waived_at` into the evidence chain,
  the markdown report, and the SARIF suppression justification. Hand-written
  waivers keep working unchanged; the file's leading comment block survives
  appends.
- **Reachability-based severity (`attestral/reachability.py`, on by default).** A
  severity band is defensible when the reviewer can see why. When a finding's
  component sits on an attack chain the symbolic walk shows reachable in the
  modeled design, the finding now carries that chain (`path: internal chain:
  web -> ops -> web · this component: entry+impact`) and is raised one severity
  band, capped at the chain's own severity (internal = high, external =
  critical). Deterministic, zero-dependency, runs on every scan; findings off
  every chain are never downgraded, because the absence of a modeled path is not
  evidence of safety. Reachable findings also score the full OWASP AIVSS threat
  multiplier (1.0). The chain and any escalation are recorded in the finding -
  and therefore in the evidence chain, the markdown report, and SARIF severity -
  and `attestral compile` applies the same raised severities, so a finding a
  reachable chain lifts to critical denies its server in the runtime policy too.
- **Baseline / diff-aware scanning (`attestral scan --baseline <file>`).** A
  brownfield repo's first scan can surface hundreds of pre-existing findings, and
  a wall of day-one debt gets a scanner uninstalled. `--baseline` records the
  current finding set once (fingerprint = `rule_id::component_id`, the identity
  waivers key on); later scans then report only findings NOT in the baseline - the
  net-new issues a change introduced - so a team can adopt on a large existing
  codebase and gate CI on what a PR actually adds. `--update-baseline` re-records.
  New `attestral/baseline.py`; tests in `tests/test_baseline.py`.

### Changed
- **Adversarial validation reframed from "proof" to reachability.** The `validate`
  walk shows an attack path is *reachable in the modeled graph* (over declared
  capability, a sound over-approximation) - a necessary, not sufficient, condition
  for exploitation. The CLI, terminal report, and every site page now say so
  explicitly, and each non-empty report states the assumption. Overclaiming
  "proof" of exploitability to a security audience is the fastest way to lose it;
  the honest framing is more credible, not less. `--fail-on-reachable` is the new
  flag name (`--fail-on-proof` stays as a deprecated alias). No logic changed.

### Added
- **Agentic-detection benchmark (`evaluation/`).** The moat is agentic detection,
  so it is now measured. `python -m evaluation.score` reports recall on labelled
  positive cases (regression: every labelled finding must fire), the
  false-positive rate on benign designs (the noise number that decides adoption),
  and agentic-rule coverage, plus known design-time gaps (rug-pull-class threats a
  static snapshot cannot see). Enforced in CI via `tests/test_evaluation.py`
  (recall 100%, benign false positives 0). First honest numbers on the moat
  surface; grows toward threat-labelled and adversarial cases (see ROADMAP.md).
- **Real-world evaluation tier (`evaluation/real-world.md` + `real-world.json`).**
  The benchmark now includes a tier tied to reality: attestral run against 33 of
  the most popular public MCP servers at pinned commits. Aggregate only (no repo
  named; per-server results are under responsible-disclosure embargo). Of the 23
  that shipped a modelable config, 52% auto-install an unpinned package, 48% expose
  an unauthenticated remote, and 22% carry a lethal trifecta; the 9 newest agentic
  rules fired on 0 of 33 (a real false-positive read). Borderline finding classes
  are called out with caveats, not headlined. `python -m evaluation.score` prints
  this alongside the synthetic regression tier.
- **ROADMAP.md** - an adoption-ordered roadmap: conviction (time-to-first-value,
  false-positive rate) first, the differentiated signed/IFC-grounded artifact
  second, with the research-grounded uplifts (signed evidence chain, information-
  flow lattice, provable policy narrowing, runtime rug-pull drift) sequenced after
  the table stakes.
- **MCP capability-abuse + coding-agent-trust rule wave (ATL-125..128).** Two new
  ingester signals feed four design-time rules grounded in this quarter's primary
  research:
  - `mcp.py` now surfaces `_declared_capabilities` - the protocol capabilities a
    server config *declares* (distinct from the coarse reachability `_capabilities`
    set). **ATL-125** flags a declared `sampling` capability (a server that can
    spend the user's model tokens and steer tool calls; Unit 42, 2025-12) and
    **ATL-126** a declared `elicitation` capability (deceptive user-prompt channel;
    "When MCP Servers Attack", 2025-09).
  - `agent_config.py` now surfaces `_bypass_permissions` and
    `_auto_enable_project_mcp` from a committed `.claude/settings.json`. **ATL-127**
    flags a permission mode that bypasses the approval prompt (CVE-2026-33068) and
    **ATL-128** flags `enableAllProjectMcpServers`, which auto-starts every
    project-declared MCP server without consent (CVE-2026-21852).
  - Both signals fail closed: absence of the config key never fires. Fixtures:
    `examples/mcp-capabilities`, `examples/coding-agent-trust`. Tests:
    `tests/test_capability_trust_rules.py`.

- **New design-time surfaces: A2A card hardening + MCP Registry manifests
  (ATL-129..133).**
  - The A2A agent-card ingester now reads card *signing* and *OAuth flow*
    structure. **ATL-129** flags a card still offering the OAuth2 implicit/password
    grants removed in A2A 1.0, and **ATL-130** flags a publicly-invocable card with
    no `signatures[]` (a peer cannot verify it is authentic).
  - A new `ingest_registry` reads MCP Registry `server.json` manifests (schema
    2025-12-11) as `mcp_registry_manifest` components. **ATL-131** flags a
    credential baked into the published manifest (a secret variable/header carrying
    a literal value), **ATL-132** a secret-named variable left without `isSecret`
    (so nothing redacts it), and **ATL-133** a deprecated HTTP+SSE transport
    (SEP-2596). Content-gated so an unrelated `server.json` is never mistaken for a
    manifest. Fixtures: `examples/a2a-hardening`, `examples/mcp-registry`. Tests:
    `tests/test_registry_a2a_rules.py`.

### Changed
- **Framework citations refreshed to the current agentic standards.** The legacy
  `OWASP-AgSec` (T1-T15) tags are fully retired in favour of the finalized
  **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026** (`ASI0N:2026`), and the MCP rules
  now also carry the new **OWASP MCP Top 10** codes (`MCP0N:2025`). MCP
  transport/auth/supply-chain/shadowing rules additionally cite the **NSA CSI on
  MCP security** (05/2026) and the new MITRE ATLAS agentic techniques (rug pull
  `AML.T0109`, tool poisoning `AML.T0110`, poisoned-tool publish `AML.T0104`), and
  the `MCP Security Best Practices` references move from the 2025-06-18 to the
  current 2025-11-25 spec revision. Citations are audit artifacts; no detection
  logic changed. The ML tier's prompt-injection finding migrates to `ASI01:2026`.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Deeper adversarial validation on `attestral validate`.** Three capabilities
  on top of the symbolic proof:
  - `--action-space` enumerates the tool-call sequences the fleet can be induced
    into (behavioral modeling), not just the one collapsed kill chain.
  - `--remediate` gives the minimal fix for each proven path, each **verified by
    re-synthesis**: strip the rung, rebuild the model, confirm the path is gone.
    A fix that drops the path count to zero is *proven* to close it, not merely
    advised. Each fix also reports the **risk-posture delta** - the worst OWASP
    AIVSS agentic score (AARS) before vs after - and fixes are ranked by how far
    they lower it, so the highest-leverage change comes first. Deterministic; the
    original model is never mutated.
  - `--generate` (opt-in, needs an API key) has an LLM draft the *predicted*
    exploit for a proven path - injection shape, tool-call sequence, transcript -
    labeled predicted, never executed, scoped to the design you own. Graceful
    skip without a key.
  - `--execute` (tier 2, sandbox) replays a proven path through Attestral's own
    stub tools with a planted canary, moving the marker from a stub secret store
    to a captured sink and recording the transcript. Deterministic; no real
    system, secret, or network is touched. Execution against your own live target
    stays gated and future. Tests: `tests/test_redteam.py`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Agentic AI Risk Score (`attestral scan --aivss`).** New `attestral/aivss.py`
  scores agentic findings with an OWASP AIVSS Agentic AI Risk Score (AARS) and
  ranks them, mapping each to an OWASP Agentic (ASI) / LLM Top-10 category. AARS
  measures agentic amplification, a different axis from CVSS severity, so a
  compositional fleet risk like the lethal trifecta outranks a high-CVSS but
  contained one. The score also flows into the **SARIF export** (result `rank`
  0-100 plus a `properties.aivss` block, so it orders GitHub Code Scanning) and
  the **JSON report** (a separate `aivss` key), kept out of the evidence chain so
  its hashes stay reproducible. The terminal ranking is opt-in via `--aivss`.
  Tests: `tests/test_aivss.py`.

### Changed
- **Findings are de-duplicated** by (rule, component): a server discovered in
  several configs no longer inflates the count with identical rows, so the total
  reflects distinct issues.
- **Prompt-injection scoring runs by default.** The zero-dependency heuristic ML
  tier now runs on every `attestral scan`, so language surfaces (MCP tool
  descriptions, system prompts, agent-instruction files) are checked for prompt
  injection without a flag. It stays deterministic and offline. `--no-ml`
  disables the layer; `--ml` or `--ml-engine onnx|deberta` (or
  `ATTESTRAL_ML_ENGINE`) opts into the model-grade tiers. Findings still carry
  `origin: ml` and are scored, never hard-blocked. This changes the default
  finding count on fixtures with planted injection text (e.g. `vulnerable-agent`
  now reports 16, memory-poisoning 1); the fixture-README sync guard includes the
  heuristic tier accordingly.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **LLM-as-judge, reworked for reliability**: the judge now defaults to
  `claude-opus-4-8` with adaptive thinking and a schema-constrained verdict
  (structured outputs on supported models), so a well-formed result is
  guaranteed rather than parsed hopefully. A `--judge-panel N` run is now a real
  cross-examination, each panelist reviews through a distinct adversarial lens
  (exploitability, compensating-control false positive, blast radius) instead of
  polling one identical prompt N times. Errors are no longer swallowed: a fatal
  error (bad key, no model access) stops the run and is reported with the real
  message, and any finding a transient error leaves unverified is surfaced. New
  `--judge-effort` (low..max) tunes rigor per run.

### Added
- **Adversarial validation, tier 0 (`attestral validate`)**: a new command and
  `attestral/redteam.py` module that walks each assembled attack path over the
  model's own edges and turns it into a *proof of traversability* - naming the
  capability at each rung and the trust boundaries the walk crosses - then
  commits it to the evidence chain as a `redteam`-origin finding
  (`ATL-RT-EXTERNAL`/`ATL-RT-INTERNAL`). Symbolic tier: deterministic, zero-dep,
  no execution, no network; a design with no complete path proves nothing (an
  attestable negative). The generative and executed tiers build on the same
  proof schema (`research/adversarial-validation-spike.md`). Tests:
  `tests/test_redteam.py`.
- **Guardrails-consistency review**: the agent-config ingester now parses NeMo
  Guardrails configurations (`rails:`/`colang_version`/engine-bearing `models:`
  YAML, with explicit negatives for Kubernetes, compose, waiver, and MCP files)
  into `guardrails_config` components with derived rail attributes. Two rules
  reason over them: **ATL-212 (high)** pairs a rails config with an
  auto-approved shell-capable tool - the rails govern the dialog channel while
  execution runs outside it, a contradiction neither file shows on its own -
  and **ATL-124 (medium)** flags rails that declare input flows but no output
  flows, so replies leave un-railed (OWASP LLM05:2025, NIST SI-15). Fixture:
  `examples/guardrails-gap/`.
- **Shared-identity data access (ATL-211, high)**: a new model-level
  `model_shared_identity_reach` matcher pairs a publicly callable A2A endpoint
  with a data-access server that reaches its store through one static service
  credential (`_shared_static_credential`, derived by the MCP ingester when a
  server has env secrets plus a database/memory/saas_data capability). Every
  external caller reads with the same downstream identity, so per-caller
  entitlements cannot be enforced at the store; the remediation is per-caller
  token exchange (RFC 8693). Neither side is a finding alone - only the system
  model sees the pair. Fixture: `examples/rag-shared-identity/`.
- **Azure AI Search exposure (ATL-336, high)**: flags
  `azurerm_search_service` with public network access enabled - for agent
  stacks this is the RAG retrieval index as a knowledge-base exposure and
  poisoning surface.
- The MCP ingester's memory/vector-store capability hints now also recognize
  `pgvector` and `faiss` backends.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Website data regeneration scripts**: the architecture page's embedded code
  graph and the docs page's baked payloads are now generated, not hand-baked.
  `scripts/render_codegraph.py` re-extracts the module graph from
  `.codegraph/codegraph.db` (plus an `ast` sweep that classifies lazy imports
  by position, fixing flags the original bake got wrong) and re-injects it into
  `website/architecture.html`; `scripts/render_docs_data.py` regenerates the
  searchable rule index and the evidence-chain demo entries in
  `website/docs.html` from the live rule packs and a real scan of
  `examples/demo-project`. Both support `--check` as a drift guard and are part
  of the release routine, like the fixture README re-scans.
- **Interactive docs page**: `website/docs.html` now opens with a tabbed
  terminal showing real captured output for the full loop (scan, explain,
  compile, drift, verify), ships a searchable, filterable index of every
  built-in rule with `attestral explain`-style detail cards, and an
  evidence-chain tamper demo that recomputes the SHA-256 chain in the browser
  with the exact algorithm `attestral verify` uses. Also fixes stale content:
  the drift table now documents DRF-001 through DRF-007, the scan flag table
  covers `--local`, `--ml`, `--judge`, `--waivers`, `-q`, and the `aibom`
  format, and the roadmap no longer lists shipped HCL resolution as future
  work.
- **Internal attack paths**: the path synthesizer now also assembles the
  *internal* kill chain, where the entry is a tool that ingests
  attacker-influenceable content (a web fetcher, a SaaS reader, a memory store)
  rather than an external A2A endpoint: untrusted input → code execution →
  exfiltration or cloud. The terminal report renders both external and internal
  chains in the "Attack paths" block, labelled by kind. The internal chain is a
  rendered synthesis, not a new finding: ATL-207 (toxic flow) and ATL-203
  (shell + network) already gate it, so a third finding would be noise. This is
  the majority case, since most agent setups have no A2A endpoint. Fixture:
  `examples/internal-attack-path/`.
- **ML layer explainer**: `docs/ml-deberta.md` walks through what DeBERTa is,
  the ideas behind it (disentangled attention, ELECTRA-style pre-training), and
  exactly how Attestral wires it into the prompt-injection scoring path.
- **Cross-server attack-path synthesis (ATL-210, critical)**: a new `attestral/
  paths.py` synthesizer assembles individual 2-way findings into a complete,
  named kill chain - an externally-reachable A2A endpoint (entry) → a
  code-execution tool (pivot) → an exfiltration channel or cloud credential
  (impact), all in one runtime. Where the per-component rules see the rungs,
  ATL-210 traces the whole ladder and names every hop (`external agent via
  public A2A endpoint [X] → code execution [Y] → exfiltration [Z]`). It fires
  only on a genuinely complete path (all three stages) and the pivot may come
  from a subagent tool grant, not just an MCP server. New fail-closed
  `model_attack_path` matcher. Fixture: `examples/attack-path/`;
  `examples/multi-agent/` gains the assembled chain on top of its rungs.

### Changed
- The "Attack paths" report block header no longer uses a decorative glyph.
- Product output follows the house style everywhere: `attestral verify` prints
  `chain VALID` / `chain INVALID - report has been altered` with no glyphs, the
  markdown report's no-active-findings line loses its glyph, and the em dashes
  in ATL-210's finding detail and ATL-505's description are now plain hyphens.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **External → cloud reachability across the A2A boundary (ATL-209, critical)**:
  a new fail-closed `model_external_cloud_reach` matcher fires when an
  effectively-public A2A endpoint shares a runtime with a tool server that holds
  cloud credentials (`_has_cloud_credentials`) - an external agent can reach the
  card, delegate a task, drive the cloud-credentialed tool, and pivot into the
  cloud account (`caller → endpoint → tool → cloud`). This is the anti-pattern
  the A2A / RFC 8693 scoped-token-exchange guidance exists to prevent, and it
  extends the agent↔cloud moat to the inter-agent boundary. Fixture:
  `examples/a2a-cloud-reach/`. (Grounded: the AgentCard spec carries no
  downstream-agent field, so a multi-hop *delegation graph* isn't statically
  modelable - but this external→cloud path is, from components already ingested.)
- **A2A inter-agent depth (OWASP ASI07)**: the A2A ingester now distinguishes
  `securitySchemes` (auth *defined*) from `security` (auth *required*), per the
  AgentCard spec, and captures the exposed skill surface. New **ATL-123** flags
  a card that declares schemes but requires none - a public agent that looks
  protected. New **ATL-208** (cross-boundary, critical) fires when an
  effectively-public A2A endpoint fronts a runtime whose tools carry a sensitive
  capability (shell/filesystem/database/memory/saas_data): an external agent can
  reach internal tools through the endpoint - the inter-agent analogue of the
  lethal trifecta, via the new fail-closed `model_external_agent_reach` matcher.
  Fixture: `examples/a2a-exposure/`. The existing `examples/multi-agent/` fixture
  now also flags ATL-208 (its unauthenticated card fronts a filesystem + shell
  fleet).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **AI-BOM export** (`attestral scan <path> --format aibom -o inv` →
  `inv.cdx.json`): the agent stack as a CycloneDX 1.6 inventory. Stdio MCP
  servers and subagents become `components` (with `pkg:npm`/`pkg:pypi` purls
  when the launch pins a package version, capability classes, and the
  canonical manifest SHA-256 that DRF-005 enforces at runtime); remote MCP
  servers and A2A agent cards become `services` with their real
  `authenticated` state and `x-trust-boundary`; instruction/prompt surfaces
  are `data` components; the delegation/tool-access graph is the
  `dependencies` entry. Cloud resources are deliberately excluded - they
  belong in an infrastructure SBOM. Findings say what is wrong; the BOM says
  what is there.
- **Multi-agent delegation modeling**: Claude Code subagent definitions
  (`.claude/agents/*.md`) are ingested as `subagent` components whose
  frontmatter `tools:` grants derive capabilities (Bash → shell,
  WebFetch/WebSearch → network, Read/Write/... → filesystem), and the
  fleet-level rules (ATL-202/203/207) now reason over the **delegation
  closure** - an MCP fleet with no shell still completes shell+network through
  a delegate, and the finding names the chain (`filesystem via notes; network
  via deploy-bot`). Wildcard delegates (no `tools:` key) are flagged as
  excessive agency (**ATL-120**) but deliberately contribute no capabilities -
  unknown grants are never guessed into findings. Shell-granted delegates are
  **ATL-119**. A2A agent cards (`.well-known/agent-card.json` / `agent.json`)
  are ingested as `a2a_agent` components: no declared `securitySchemes`/
  `security` is a public agent (**ATL-121**, OWASP-ASI07) and a plaintext
  `http://` endpoint is **ATL-122**. Fixture: `examples/multi-agent/` - its
  MCP fleet is safe on its own; every fleet finding exists only across the
  delegation hop.
- **Static HCL resolution** in the Terraform ingester: `var.x` resolves from
  `variable` defaults overridden by `terraform.tfvars`/`*.auto.tfvars` (root
  modules only, per Terraform semantics), `local.x` resolves iteratively,
  `"${..}"` interpolations substitute when fully decidable, and **local
  `module` calls are instantiated** once per call under their real Terraform
  address (`module.<name>.<type>.<rname>`) with call inputs overriding module
  defaults (registry/git modules skipped; cycles cut; depth bounded). This is
  the multiplier that makes the cloud rule pack fire on real-world repos, not
  just literal-value fixtures. Fail-open contract: anything not statically
  decidable stays exactly as written - resolution adds provable findings,
  never guessed ones. Both parse tiers (python-hcl2 and the dependency-free
  scanner, which now also strips inline comments) resolve identically.
  Fixture: `examples/hcl-resolution/` - no risky literal anywhere; every
  finding requires resolution.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Known-CVE MCP package detection** (ATL-117): an embedded, curated advisory
  DB flags a server launched at a package version with a published CVE, using a
  real version-range check - e.g. `mcp-remote@<=0.1.15` (CVE-2025-6514, OS
  command injection to RCE). Unpinned/patched versions are not flagged.
- **Agent hook config-injection detection** (ATL-118): a new `agent_config`
  ingester parses `.claude/settings.json`-style settings and flags hooks that
  run shell commands - the config-injection class behind CVE-2025-59536 in
  Claude Code, where a repo-supplied settings file executes code on trust.
  Fixture: `examples/hook-injection/`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Cloud IaC expansion to 146 rules** across AWS/Azure/GCP/Kubernetes, hitting
  the ~150 high-signal CIS-check target. Rules now live in modular
  `rules/<provider>_pack.yaml` files auto-loaded by the engine: **AWS** +28
  (ATL-027..054: S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, CloudFront, Redshift, OpenSearch,
  DocumentDB, EKS, SageMaker, MSK, Kinesis, ElastiCache, and more), **Azure**
  +19 (ATL-317..335: storage, Key Vault, Cosmos DB, Redis, ACR, App/Function
  apps, AKS, Service Bus, Event Hub), **GCP** +19 (ATL-414..432: Compute, GKE,
  Cloud SQL, Storage, BigQuery, Cloud Functions/Run, DNSSEC, IAM, KMS), and
  **Kubernetes** +15 (ATL-511..525: Pod Security Standards - runAsNonRoot,
  seccomp, capability drops, service-account token automount, host namespaces,
  probes, and more, with additive derived attributes in the K8s ingester).
  Total pack: **169 rules**.
- **Agent skills scanning** (ATL-116): `SKILL.md` skill manifests are ingested
  as agent-instruction components, so world-writable skills (ATL-113) and
  injection text in skills are already covered; ATL-116 additionally flags a
  skill whose `allowed-tools` frontmatter grants shell/exec or wildcard access
  (excessive agency in a shareable, auto-loaded artifact). Closes the
  agent-skills coverage gap versus Snyk Agent Scan / Cisco AI Defense.
- **Confused-deputy / token-passthrough detection** (ATL-115, MCP Security Best
  Practices 2025-06-18): a network-reachable MCP server that also holds a
  downstream credential (secret in env or a forwarded auth/token header) is
  flagged - it can be induced to spend that delegated authority for an attacker
  or pass the token onward. New derived attribute `_confused_deputy`.
- **Toxic-flow / taint-path detection** (ATL-207, Kim et al. 2026 R3): a new
  fail-closed `model_taint_flow` matcher fires when the fleet contains a server
  that ingests untrusted external content (network/SaaS/memory - taint source)
  and a server that executes commands (taint sink), naming the actual source
  and sink servers. The flow is recorded as `taint_source`/`taint_sink` edges in
  the model (and thus the attested hash) - the structural signal a per-resource
  linter can't produce. Closes the information-flow gap from the threat-model doc.
- **R7 resource-drain / DoS budgets** (Kim et al. 2026 R7): the compiled policy
  now carries a tunable `budgets` block, and `drift` enforces it against runtime
  telemetry - a runaway tool-call loop (**DRF-006**: consecutive identical calls
  past `loop_repeat_threshold`, or a same-tool run with varying arguments past
  2x) and per-server call volume over `max_calls_per_server` (**DRF-007**, for
  attested servers). Budgets fail closed on malformed values and a budget of 0
  is enforced, not ignored. Closes the first open gap from
  docs/agentic-threat-model.md.

### Fixed
- Hardened the v0.9 additions after an adversarial review pass: ATL-115 no
  longer flags a correctly-authenticated remote server (a client auth header is
  inbound auth, not a downstream credential); drift budgets fail closed on
  non-integer values instead of crashing; DRF-006 only counts *consecutive*
  runs (no false positives from spaced-out identical calls) and now also catches
  varying-argument loops; DRF-007 ignores unattested servers; and the
  `model_taint_flow` matcher fails closed on a non-list spec.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Azure cloud-parity wave** (CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations + CIS AKS
  grounded): the Azure band grows from 8 to 16 high-signal rules - storage
  infrastructure encryption off (ATL-309) and TLS below 1.2 (ATL-310); Key
  Vault public network access (ATL-311); SQL database transparent data
  encryption off (ATL-312); App Service not HTTPS-only (ATL-313); Linux VM
  password authentication (ATL-314); AKS local accounts enabled (ATL-315);
  and PostgreSQL flexible server public network access (ATL-316). Fixture:
  `examples/multicloud-k8s/azure.tf`.
- **Agent-security SoK mapping** (Kim et al., _The Attack and Defense Landscape
  of Agentic AI_, arXiv:2603.11088, 2026): the agentic rule pack is mapped to
  the survey's V1-V6 attack vectors and R1-R7 risk taxonomy in
  [docs/agentic-threat-model.md](docs/agentic-threat-model.md), with
  `Agentic-SoK 2026 <code>` framework citations on the mapped rules. New rule
  **ATL-114**: persistent agent memory / vector stores are detected (new
  `memory` capability class) as memory-poisoning targets (V6) and now count as
  private data toward the ATL-202 lethal-trifecta exfiltration chain.
- **GCP cloud-parity wave** (CIS GCP Foundations + CIS GKE-grounded): the GCP
  band grows from 5 to 13 high-signal rules - Compute full cloud-platform scope
  (ATL-406), IP forwarding (ATL-407) and non-Shielded VMs (ATL-408); GKE
  non-private nodes (ATL-409), non-Shielded nodes (ATL-410) and client-cert
  auth (ATL-411); public bucket IAM to `allUsers` (ATL-412); and KMS keys
  without a rotation period (ATL-413). Fixture: `examples/multicloud-k8s/gcp.tf`.
- **Rug-pull detection with teeth**: every MCP server's tool manifest (launch
  identity + tool surface) is canonically hashed at scan time
  (`attestral/manifest.py`), pinned into the compiled policy as
  `manifest_sha256`, and re-checked by `drift` - a mismatch is DRF-005
  (critical): the tool that runs is not the tool that was reviewed.
- **Agent→cloud reachability edges**: cloud provider credentials in a tool
  server's env are detected (`_has_cloud_credentials`), flagged as ATL-112
  (high), and recorded as a `tool_access` edge from the server to the cloud
  boundary - the crossing becomes part of the attested model hash.
- **Memory/context poisoning (OWASP ASI06)**: standing agent-instruction files
  (CLAUDE.md, `.cursorrules`, AGENTS.md, `.windsurfrules`, Copilot
  instructions) are ingested as `agent_instruction` components. World-writable
  instruction files fire ATL-113 (high, deterministic); the file content is
  scored for embedded injection by the ML layer. Fixture:
  `examples/memory-poisoning/`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Agentic depth wave** (OWASP ASI 2026-anchored): auto-approved tool execution
  (ATL-108), unauthenticated remote MCP servers (ATL-109), credentials in argv
  (ATL-110), broad host mounts into MCP containers (ATL-111).
- **Fleet-level combination rules** via the new capability model and
  `model_capability_combo` matcher: lethal-trifecta exfiltration chain (ATL-202)
  and shell + network reach (ATL-203) - findings only a system model can produce.
- **Cross-server tool shadowing detection** (SAFE-MCP SAF-T1301-anchored,
  fixture `examples/tool-shadowing/`): tool-name collisions (ATL-204),
  cross-server steering in tool descriptions (ATL-205), and server-identity
  conflicts across config scopes (ATL-206) - all model-level; findings now
  carry per-instance detail (which tool, which servers, which sources).
- `attestral scan --local`: audits MCP servers already installed on the machine
  (Claude Code - user scope, project `.mcp.json`, and the current project's
  local scope nested in `~/.claude.json` - plus Claude Desktop, Cursor,
  VS Code, Windsurf). Prints an inventory of the reviewed agent tool surface
  (server, transport, capability classes, source) and per-source server
  counts, so a clean scan shows its work and an empty config is
  distinguishable from a broken one.
- `attestral init`: one-command scaffold of CI workflow, pre-commit config, and
  waivers file. Pre-commit hooks (`attestral`, `attestral-local`).
- Terminal-first output: colour-coded review printed to the terminal, nothing
  written to disk unless `-o`/`--format` is passed.
- Docs-sync gate: README diagrams, CLI docs, and this changelog are enforced by
  the test suite.
- OWASP ASI:2026 framework references across the agentic rule pack (66 rules total).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- ML layer tier 3: fine-tunable DeBERTa prompt-injection classifier
  (`attestral[ml]`), joining the zero-dep heuristic and ONNX tiers; all tiers
  emit byte-identical findings.
- Rule pack grown to 57 rules: AWS extras plus new Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes
  packs (CIS-grounded).
- `training/`: fine-tune and threshold-calibration recipe for the ML layer.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Rule pack grown to 26 rules (CIS AWS + OWASP LLM Top 10 + MCP supply-chain
  research: auto-install, mutable tags, outbound fetch/browser tools).
- Judge testability: deterministic judge harness; live judge test skips
  without an API key.
- Diagrammatic docs: pipeline and command-loop Mermaid diagrams.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- LLM-as-judge verifier layer (`--judge`): panel voting, verdicts recorded in
  the evidence chain, `--judge-suppress` auto-waives confident false positives
  on the record.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Baseline + waivers: documented, expiring exceptions
  (`attestral-waivers.yaml`); waived findings stay in the evidence chain and
  become SARIF suppressions.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- SARIF 2.1.0 output for GitHub Code Scanning (`--format sarif`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- First release: system model (components, edges, trust boundaries), Terraform
  + MCP ingestion, 10-rule deterministic pack, SHA-256 evidence chain with
  offline `verify`, `compile` to default-deny mcp-guard policy, `drift`
  detection against runtime telemetry, CLI with CI gate (`--fail-on`).
